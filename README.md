# Kafka-TS
A toy Kafka consumer written in Typescript.

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Developing
Most of the core code exists in `kafkaConsumerEngine.ts`

Another entry point is `index.ts`

This consumer is developed with Hot-Module-Reloading at the core. This means most changes will not need a complete restart of the consumer.
